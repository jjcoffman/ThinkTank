After the software has been loaded, please refer to the instructions below to learn how to navigate through the main menu, to use objects in the simulation, the camera controls once in the simulator, and how to save scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# First Time Setup\r\n\r\nYou may choose to run the simulator off a directory of your choosing.  You may choose to run it off your hard drive, flash drive, or the school’s network drive.  \r\n1.3.1\tCompressed (.zip) File  \r\nIf you are presented the Cichlid Simulator in a compressed  (.zip) file, extract it to your preferred directory, then run the extracted .jar to begin the simulation.  \r\n1.3.2\tCreating Necessary File Folders  \r\nRun the .jar for the first time, and the program will create two folders in the same directory of itself.   \r\nScenarios  \r\nYou can drag and drop Scenario files to this folder.  Scenarios in this folder will appear in the “Load Scenario” menu.  \r\nSettings  \r\nThe horizontal resolution determines the width of the simulator (in pixels)  \r\nthe vertical resolution determines the height of the simulator (in pixels)  \r\nVSync (on or off)  \r\nThese resolution settings should correspond to a preferred aspect ratio(such as 16:9 or 4:3). The default for these values for horizontal and vertical resolution are  640 and 480 respectively, and VSync is on.  \r\n\r\n\r\n# Download\r\n\r\n[Simulator.jar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GkvxFwFZRTQzVVcGItZjBsb2s/view?usp=sharing)  \r\n(SHA56 - 1ac9159c631dd55c4fcb450366a72ec1b86239dfee2d2010603c4c55586d3c00)\r\n\r\n# Contributors\r\n@jjcoffman, @vashlor, @vrel, @chik3nalfredo, @neoprotector",
